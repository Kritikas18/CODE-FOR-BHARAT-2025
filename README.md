BLOOD DONATION WEBSITE FOR A SAFER WORLD.
REDPULSE is a modern, responsive web platform designed to simplify and speed up the process of blood donation. It connects donors, hospitals, and patients in one place, with a clean interface and real-time features. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project focuses on saving lives by making the donation process faster, more accessible, and transparent.

Donors can register easily, see live hospital requests, and mark their availability.

Patients can submit blood requests by selecting hospital and blood group through a simple form.

Hospitals can post urgent blood needs, manage incoming requests, and search for donors.

A live donor counter and scrolling marquee keep users updated on real-time activity.

Each dashboard (donor, hospital, patient) is designed with user-friendly navigation.

Pages include smooth slide transitions, glow-on-hover effects, and carousel image banners.

The layout is fully responsive and looks great on desktops, tablets, and phones.

The project is hosted on Vercel, ensuring fast loading and easy sharing.

Future scope includes Google Maps integration, email/SMS alerts, and backend database for storing requests and user data.

This project was built during a hackathon as a real-world solution to make blood donation smarter and faster. Designed and developed by Kritika Singh with a mission to use tech for saving lives.
